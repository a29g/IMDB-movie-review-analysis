It is common knowledge that, usually, moviegoers, called users or reviewers in the rest of this project, utilize movie ratings and reviews in selecting their next movie to see/watch. This is indeed the case for the authors of this project. And, unfortunately, sometimes movie reviews and ratings do not help users make the right choices, as evidenced by their emotional feelings after watching the movie. This is perhaps because users desire a certain emotional state after watching a movie, which does not match the emotions evoked by the selected movie. Clearly, userâ€™s reviews and ratings for a movie are strongly tied to their emotions evoked by the movie. This project argues that 1) It may be useful for users in their decision-making process to choose the next movie to watch if a movie also comes with an (expected) emotion signature or an emotion map. 2) Towards goal 1, we can build automated software tools that (i) Analyse movie reviews and ratings, and (ii) Provide an emotional signature from the reviews and ratings of any movie.
